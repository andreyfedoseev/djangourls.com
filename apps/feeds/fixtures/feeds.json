In 2005 I was introduced by co-worker <a href=\"http://koansys.com/\">Chris Shenton</a> to <a href=\"http://python.org/\">Python</a>, which became my favorite programming language ever. I also learned tools like <a href=\"http://zope.org/\">Zope</a>, <a href=\"http://plone.org/\">Plone</a>, and <a href=\"http://django.org/\">Django</a>.

That includes astronauts, scientists, engineers, developers, managers, and so much more.<div><br /></div><div><div>This meant so much to me, and maybe because my first memories of television as a child were the moon landings of the early 1970s.

The project will be Python/Django/<a href=\"http://www.linux.org/\">Linux</a> based, and the client insists on accessibility, testing, and quality work. We'll be exploring the boundaries of what has been done with those tools and besides what must remain proprietary, a lot of our work will end up going back to the community.

We use quite a few 3rd-party Django apps that we pull from PyPi, along with several apps - both internal and 3rd-party - from Github and Bitbucket.  I'm a huge fan of virtualenv and pip and I love managing our environments with these tools.  When we need to add a new requirement, we simply add it to our requirements.txt and on the next deploy pip will grab it for us on each of our web nodes.</p>\n<h2>The Problems</h2>\n<p>We ran into a couple of issues along the way, however, and I found that a local PyPi server solved them quite nicely for us.</p>\n<h3>Stuck in Downtime Limbo</h3>\n<p>Before we started running a local PyPi server, when PyPi, Github, or Bitbucket went down we couldn't deploy - or worse yet we'd get stuck in the <strong>middle</strong> of a deploy and have to wait for the service to be restored before we could bring the site back out of maintenance mode.  We were lucky that it only happened once and only left us hanging for about 10 minutes, but it could easily have been much worse.  I knew that we had to take control of our package sources so that we could be responsible for their availability.</p>\n<h3>Installing From Github, Bitbucket, and .tar.gz is Slow</h3>\n<p>Even when the services are up, installing requirements directly from Github or Bitbucket using the <em>-e</em> option is very slow.  For each repository, pip does a full checkout from scratch for the requested revision.  For large repos, this takes quite a few seconds, and when you have a large list of requirements being installed on multiple web nodes for multiple sites, those seconds add up.</p>\n<p>When using plain .tar.gz files for the packages, hosted from our lighttpd server, pip would have to download each archive, decompress, and then use the setup script to gather version info.  This added up quickly as well.</p>\n<h3>We Can't Upload Internal Packages to PyPi</h3>\n<p>Our internal Django apps are not open-source, so we can't upload them to the general PyPi index.  In addition, we have a few custom packages made from snippets or examples that don't have a clear open-source license.</p>\n<h2>Chishop</h2>\n<p>When running through our requirements on PyPi, however, pip would go very fast.  It would hit PyPi to grab version info, and then compare with what is already installed.  A large list of requirements could be scanned by pip in no time!  After looking around at the available options, I decided to go with <a href=\"http://github.com/ask/chishop\">Chishop</a> because it is based on Django.  The standard views are used to list and retrieve package information, and the admin views are used for manually administrating the projects and packages on your server.  Most of the time, however, you can simply interact with your local PyPi server using the setup.py files in each app you work with.</p>\n<h1>Deploying With Gunicorn</h1>\n<p>I wanted to run Chishop on a completely separate process than our production Apache instance, but I didn't want to deal with all the overhead of running an additional, isolated Apache service.  I've been hearing Django devs like <a href=\"http://justinlilly.com/blog/2010/jan/31/server-switch-light-and-fast/\" title=\"The Server Switch: Light and Fast\">Justin Lilly</a> talk about their experiences with <a href=\"http://gunicorn.org/\" title=\"Green Unicorn\">Gunicorn</a> lately, so I decided to give it a try.  After installing, I used the following <a href=\"http://supervisord.org/\">Supervisord</a> config block to get the process up and running:</p>\n<pre><code>[program:gunicorn]\ncommand=/path/to/chishop/bin/django run_gunicorn 12.34.56.789:8123\ndirectory=/path/to/chishop/chishop\nuser=myuser\nautostart=true\nautorestart=true\nredirect_stderr=true\n</code></pre>\n<p>After rereading my Supervisord config, Gunicorn was off and running and my Chishop instance was live.</p>\n<h1>Configuring My Local Machine</h1>\n<p>To configure my local machine to access our local PyPi server, I needed to create a ~/.pypirc file. If you don't already have a pypi username and password, you should be able to leave the values at the 'user' and 'secret' values below, and just never try to upload anything to PyPi itself.</p>\n<pre><code>[distutils]\nindex-servers =\n chishop\n    pypi\n\n[pypi]\nusername:user\npassword:secret\n\n[chishop]\nusername:user\npassword:secret\nrepository:http://my.chishop-server.com:8123\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Adding Packages</h1>\n<p>Packages uploaded to Chishop must have a functioning setup.py. Take a look at the <a href=\"http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/setup.py\">one within Django itself</a> for an example.</p>\n<p>Chishop is organized into projects, which collect the metadata for a specific package, and releases, which are specific versions of a package.  To upload a package to Chishop, use the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ python setup.py register -r chishop sdist upload -r chishop\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command registers the package metadata (from setup.py) to Chishop, and then creates a source distribution and uploads it through the command line to the server. If this command is successful, no further work is needed to make the package available. If something goes wrong, however, you may need to go into the Chishop admin section to manually create or alter the project &amp; release.</p>\n<h1>Installing Packages</h1>\n<p>To install a package from our Chishop server, we use pip with the -i option.</p>\n<pre><code>$ pip install ybrowserauth -i http://my.chishop-server:8123\n</code></pre>\n<p>In our deploy script, we use an additional option, <em>--extra-index-url=http://pypi.python.org/simple</em>.  This allows us to fall back to PyPi if the requested package isn't found on our Chishop instance.</p>\n<h2>Speedy Deploys!</h2>\n<p>Using this setup, our deploys are now dramatically faster and more reliable.  We have control over what packages are available, and we routinely create custom packages with specific Github revisions or modifications.  I'd definitely recommend Chishop to others looking for a similar solution.</p>", "title": "Brandon Konkle: Creating a Personal PyPi with Chishop", "url": "http://brandonkonkle.com/blog/2010/mar/25/creating-personal-pypi-chishop/", "timestamp": "2010-03-26 00:30:02", "identifier": "http://brandonkonkle.com/blog/2010/mar/25/creating-personal-pypi-chishop/"}}, {"pk": 118, "model": "feeds.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 6, "published_on": "2010-03-26 00:30:02", "description": "<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://brianleroux.github.com/lawnchair/\">Lawnchair</a> is a library that provides a client side JSON store and that's really cool. Since I'm going to be using this quite a bit in some of our applications, I started to build out some of the common uses into a library. This makes working with django models on the client side a little bit easier.</p> <p>At the moment django-lawnchair contains a few utilities to do some work on the server, but to be honest, not to much. I'm hoping I can integrate django-piston a bit to make writing that easier.</p> <p>There's a bit more on the client side of things, using django-lawnchair.js you can instantiate a database like this:</p> <pre>var todos = new djangochair('/todo/list');</pre> <p>Grabbing all the objects for a model (in this case Todo objects), populating the local database (or whatever backend store you choose) is as simple as:</p> <pre>todos.remote_get(add_row);</pre> <p>...as each Todo is added to the DB, the callback <code>add_row</code> will be called.</p>  <p>Users can interact with the objects. Each time you change a model in the local DB, we change the state. You can the push all the changed objects to Django:</p> <pre>todos.updated(function(r) { todos.remote_save(r); });</pre> <p>This will iterate through each changed object and push them to the server, where they will be saved. Got deleted objects?</p> <pre>todos.deleted(function(r) { todos.remote_delete(r, function(r) { todos.purge(r.key); });\n});</pre> <p>...and so on. There's a lot to do in this area, handling errors, handling syncing problems and so on. The library doesn't do much of that yet, it's trying to set a base line for this stuff.

We've removed a lot of old code, and significantly refactored the migration-creating code to make it more extensible (as well as not being mostly in one 3000 line file)\n\nThere are also a few new user-facing changes:\n\n<b>New command names.</b>The old startmigration was getting a little overloaded and wasn't too well-named, so it's been split into schemamigration and datamigration commands. There's also a new graphmigrations command, for those with complex dependency sets.\n\n<b>No more issues with missing defaults.</b> South realises you need a default for NOT NULL columns now, and prompts you if you forget to specify one as you're making the migration, instead of dying when you try to apply it.\n\n<b>Django 1.2 and MultiDB support.</b> As well as supporting the latest and greatest incarnation of the universe's best web framework, 0.7 also has some limited MultiDB support, in the form of a --database option (that works like the option of the same name on the new syncdb command in Django).\n\n<b>Custom fields are no longer magically used.</b> Instead, you now have to actually tell South about them. It's an ease-of-use regression, which I'm not too keen on - but it's needed to stop things mysteriously failing in your migrations a few weeks down the line, and there's a whole new tutorial section on it, as well as plenty of reference documentation (and IRC and the mailing list are always around to help).\n\nIf you want more information, read the new long-form <a href=\"http://south.aeracode.org/docs/releasenotes/0.7.html\">release notes</a>, which goes into a bit more detail on the various changes, and mentions a few I haven't included here.\n\nThere'll be a lull in development after the release as I rest, and then work will begin on the next release - 1.0*. Which features are going to appear have not yet been decided, but it's highly likely column rename support and a fixturemigration command will be among them.\n\nAnyway, why are you waiting? <a href=\"http://south.aeracode.org/docs/installation.html\">Go install South 0.7 now!</a>\n<i>* South has an octal numbering system.</i>", "title": "Andrew Godwin: South 0.7 Released", "url": "http://www.aeracode.org/2010/3/25/south-07-released/", "timestamp": "2010-03-26 00:30:02", "identifier": "http://www.aeracode.org/2010/3/25/south-07-released/"}}, {"pk": 108, "model": "feeds.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "published_on": "2010-03-25 23:22:37", "description": "<p>I get the following error when attempting to use django-openid-auth <code>OpenID discovery error: No usable OpenID services found for *******@gmail.com</code> </p>\n<p>I have followed the instructions that come with it, though it seems there is something I am missing. the installation is on my localhost. </p>", "title": "Django OpenID django-openid-auth Login Error.", "url": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2520144/django-openid-django-openid-auth-login-error", "timestamp": "2010-03-26 00:24:13", "identifier": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2520144/django-openid-django-openid-auth-login-error"}}, {"pk": 107, "model": "feeds.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "published_on": "2010-03-25 22:29:11", "description": "<p>I want to use unique hashes for each model rather than ids.</p>\n<p>I implemented the following function to use it across the board easily.</p>\n<pre><code>import random,hashlib\nfrom base64 import urlsafe_b64encode\n\ndef set_unique_random_value(model_object,field_name='hash_uuid',length=5,use_sha=True,urlencode=False):\n    while 1:\n        uuid_number = str(random.random())[2:]\n        uuid = hashlib.sha256(uuid_number).hexdigest() if use_sha else uuid_number\n        uuid = uuid[:length]\n        if urlencode:\n            uuid = urlsafe_b64encode(uuid)[:-1]\n        hash_id_dict = {field_name:uuid}\n        try:\n            model_object.__class__.objects.get(**hash_id_dict)\n        except model_object.__class__.DoesNotExist:\n            setattr(model_object,field_name,uuid)\n            return\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm seeking feedback, how else could I do it?

Now I'm seeing the cracks.</p>\n<p>First problem: The timezone seems to flip back and forth between Eastern and Central. My understanding of that from searching around on this site are that it's because the os environ var for TZ gets set to the Apache process depending on which Django site it's handling a request for, and if that process then handles a request for a site on another TZ, the timezone is wrong. I believe the solution I found here was that sites of different timezones need to have different process groups serving them. Please correct if wrong.</p>\n<p>Second problem: Locally on Linux, I did a ./manage.py runserver from one of my sites with Central time (I'm in Eastern). I created an asset, whose publish date correctly displayed as one hour behind in the admin. Looking at the actual PostgresSQL entry, the publish date's timezone is still listed as -04. Does Postgres just use the timezone of the server/computer itself and ignore any TZ setting in Django? So all entries saved on a Postgres server on Eastern time would show as -04 or -05 depending on Daylight Savings?</p>\n<p>If anyone else has dealt with something like this, advice is appreciated. Even if I split out the Apache processes for the Central sites such that their TZ settings don't cross, I still have the Postgres problem to deal with. And then I'm curious; if the PSQL timestamp is Central, and the TZ setting is Eastern, say, do the datetime fields take TZ into account? i.e., if you do datetime.datetime.now() when Django is set to EST, and it returns 2:00 PM, then you have it filter content by its publish date being less than that result, would it account for TZ by only looking for content whose publish time was 1:00PM CST or earlier?</p>", "title": "Django Timezone Confusion; Postgres and Apache", "url": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518240/django-timezone-confusion-postgres-and-apache", "timestamp": "2010-03-26 00:24:13", "identifier": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518240/django-timezone-confusion-postgres-and-apache"}}, {"pk": 109, "model": "feeds.feeditem", "fields": {"feed": 1, "published_on": "2010-03-25 17:11:09", "description": "<p>I created a database for a site i'm doing using Django as the admin backend.

Autoresponder that will send an email to a subscriber based on their email record's age. Allow me to queue up as many different autoresponder messages as I wish and let me choose when it sends out the email. (I don't just want a date here, I want to choose how long AFTER the subscriber's creation date to send the email) Give me a way to send out a mass email to everyone on the list immediately just in case I need to. Placeable tokens in the emails.
